STM32F429I-DISC1 Custom Library Drivers

Overview
This repository contains custom library drivers for the STM32F429I-DISC1 development kit. These drivers are being developed incrementally as part of a learning journey in embedded systems programming.
The code is based on the libraries developed in the FastBit Embedded Brain Academy video series and is written in C.


This project is ongoing and currently in a development phase. Contributions and suggestions are welcome!



Current Progress


Implemented Drivers:

stm32f429xx.h: Main header file for STM32F429xx series.

gpio_driver.h and gpio_driver.c: GPIO driver for configuring and using GPIO pins.

spi_driver.h and spi_driver.c: SPI driver for configuring and using SPI protocol.


In Progress: UART.c & I2C.c


Getting Started


Prerequisites

To work with this project, you will need:
